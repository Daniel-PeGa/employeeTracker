# Team Profile Generator

This is a team profile generator intended to prompt some messages in the command line with the use of inquirer, takes the user's input and creates cards for each team member added.

## Description

This project takes the manager's (user's) input necessary to create an employee profile, from manager, engeneer, or intern. The information is then processed and added to cards in an html so that it can be displayed on a browser with a more user friendly view.

## Technologies used

* jest
* node-notifier
* inquirer
* bootstrap
* jQuery

## Future development

I was thinking iit could be prettier and be deployed to Heroku, so that's something to work on, but im out of ideas of what to do with this specific project other than add it to some other one. Any ideas? Contact me!

## Usage

So far it's not deplpoyed yet, so you will have to clone it in your desktop. Once its on your computer, you can go ahead and open your code editor with the file and open the integrated terminal and type in the following commands:

```
npm i
node index.js
```

And that's it! Some prompts will show up and will ask your input on some information from the team member's profile you're creating, and after you're done, you can just go ahead and open your browser and it should show up there
